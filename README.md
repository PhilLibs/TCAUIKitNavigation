Tools for making UIKit navigation with TCA more precise.

  * [Motivation](#motivation)

## Motivation

The [Composable Architecture 
(TCA)](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) 
comes with a lot of powerful tools for 
navigation in SwiftUI. However, it still lacks good support for UIKit 
navigation. In addition navigation in vanilla SwiftUI is still broken and 
lacks some functionalities in comparison to navigation in UIKit.
